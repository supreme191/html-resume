    <title>Hobbies</title>
</head>
<body>
        <p>Outside of work and study, I find joy in a range of hobbies that keep me both mentally sharp and creatively inspired.</p>
        <p>Anime captivates me with its rich storytelling and imaginative worlds, often sparking new ideas and perspectives.</p>
        <p>Cycling offers a refreshing escape—it's my way of staying active while clearing my mind and embracing the outdoors.</p>
        <h4>Reading fuels my curiosity and deepens my understanding of diverse topics, from fiction to philosophy.</h4>
        <h4>And coding, beyond being a skill, is a passion—I enjoy experimenting with logic, building small projects, and continuously learning how to solve problems more elegantly.</h4>
        <p>Together, these hobbies reflect a balance of creativity, discipline, and a lifelong love of learning.</p>
